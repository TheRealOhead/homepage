				My name's Owen Parker. I'm <span id="age"></span><script>document.getElementById('age').innerHTML=new Date().getYear()-new Date('January 19 2004').getYear()</script> years old. I grew up in a small Massachusetts town and I'm currently attending Wentworth Institute of Technology in Boston. I have a huge passion for programming and computer science in general, so it's no surprise that my major is computer science. My favorite language is Javascript because it can do goofy browser things with very little setup, but I also know a fair amount of Java, C++, Python, Lua, and even a little bit of 6502 assembly! My secondary passions are singing and ice skating. I'm not a fantastic skater, but I enjoy it. My favorite animal is the house cat. My family back home has 3 of them. I definetly spend most of my free time playing video games. I linked my Steam to prove it. As a reward for bothering to read this, here's a secret: enter the Konami code.
